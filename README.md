# PerbaikiinAja - Order Service

This project is responsible for managing the full process of placing and handling repair service requests, from initial order creation to final completion. Users can place new repair orders, specifying item details, desired repairs, choosing a payment method, and optionally selecting their preferred technician. Technicians receive these orders, provide cost and time estimates, and update the order status as repairs progress. After technicians mark repairs as completed, users receive notifications and can view, manage, or delete these notifications to stay informed without clutter.
